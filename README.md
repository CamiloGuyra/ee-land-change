This project is a tutorial on using Google Earth Engine for Land Use Change monitoring. The file `ee-land-change.rmd` contains all code that generates the file `ee-land-change.html`, which is the actual tutorial. The `images` subdirectory contains screenshots used in the tutorial. If edits need to be made to the tutorial, modify `ee-land-change.rmd` then click "Knit HTML" to regenerate the HTML file.
